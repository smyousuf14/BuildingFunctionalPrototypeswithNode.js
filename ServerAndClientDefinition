A few important points about Node.js:
-It is a commandline tool that can be run as a web server
-It uses javascript
-It is very important when you need to do many things at the same time. 

Node.js is really suited for web games, chat rooms, and other situations where more than one user need updated information without refreashing the page. 


NOTE: An application server listens for HTTP requests and responds to them.
